# About this Repo

This is for a talk given at the [Lexington JavaScript User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Kentucky-JavaScript-Users-Group/).

Each git tag represents a step along the way. So you can `git checkout 001` and
see the first step.

The goal here is to get a really quick overview of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
by taking an example app from the first steps through routing.

# What's Not Here

Lots of stuff! The goal here was to expose the reader to react and flux in general
with some level of detail about flux and exposure to things like component
lifecycle and prop types.

Here are some more things worth looking into:

- [Stateless components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#stateless-functions)
- How to handle CSS in a react app (with webpack or otherwise).
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) - An amazing take on the flux architecture.
