# About this Repo

This is for a talk given at the [Lexington JavaScript User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Kentucky-JavaScript-Users-Group/).

Each git tag represents a step along the way. So you can `git checkout 001` and
see the first step.

The goal here is to get a really quick overview of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
by taking an example app from the first steps through routing.
